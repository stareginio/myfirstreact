# Getting Started with myfirstreact

This project is about the first React app of Sophie.
You will mostly see snails in this app. 

## Table of contents
* [Home](#home)
* [Employees](#employees)
* [Add Employees](#add-employees)

## Home
The home page consists of a counter with an add and reset button. Each click on the add button will increment the counter. There are also a few lines of greetings below it. Under the snail gif is a link to a Youtube video.

## Employees
The Employees page contains the table of the current list of employees in the database. The table shows the name, department, and location of each employee. Each entry can also be modified or removed if needed.

## Add Employees
This is where a new employee can be created or an existing employee can be edited. The name, department, and location is needed for the user's input to be saved.
